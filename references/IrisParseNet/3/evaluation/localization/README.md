Usage:
1. Before evaluation, images of parameterized inner and outer boundaries of the iris are required to be generated by various algorithms, and two common parameterization forms are circles and ellipses here.
Depending on the parameters(.ini) of circles or ellipses, you can use gen_circle_edge/gen_ellipse_edge to generate corresponding iris boundary images, as shown in the **examples** folder.

2. Then, the Hausdorff distances between the predicted boundaries and labeled boundaries are calculated and further normalized by the horizontal eye width.

3. Finally, two types of evaluation results are summarized, where one of which calculates the average value of the Hausdorff distance, i.e., mHdis, see **shape_similariry/shape_similariry_normalized**.
The second one is to draw the PCL curve and calculate the AUC, see **shape_sim_curves/shape_sim_curves_normalized**.
