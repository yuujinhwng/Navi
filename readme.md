# Navi: Iris Obfuscation
Iris biometric authentication has many advantages. It is accurate, secure, and user-friendly.  
However, in the case of a data breach, you can never recoup your stolen iris pattern or create a new one: 
unlike fingerprints, the patterns of your iris do not change even the slightest bit over time. (add link to this)

This poses a problem because digital cameras (most commonly available to us through smartphones) are getting better and better each day. With high-enough-quality photos, hackers may actually be able to extract your iris pattern from images you post on social media and create fake copies of your iris (add relevant paper) in order to hack into your device. 

Navi is an obfuscation service that imperceptibly scrambles the underlying iris patterns before you post them on the internet (i.e., social media).
